          <h2>About Semar</h2>
          <p>
            Semar is a character in Javanese mythology who frequently appears in
            wayang shadow plays. He is one of the punokawan (clowns), but is in
            fact divine and very wise. He is the dhanyang (guardian spirit) of
            Java, and is regarded by some as the most sacred figure of the
            wayang set. He is said to be the god Sang Hyang Ismaya in human
            form.

          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            In depictions, Semar appears with a flat nose, a protruding lower
            jaw, a tired eye, and bulging rear, belly, and chest. He wears a
            checkered hipcloth, symbolizing sacredness. Like the other
            panakawan, the wayang kulit puppet does not have the elaborate
            openwork and ornamentation characteristic of the heroes In wayang
            wong, Semar always leans forward, one hand palm up on his back and
            the other extended partly forward, moving up and down, with an
            extended forefinger.
          </p>
          <p>
            By tradition Semar has three sons, the other punakawans in the
            wayang: Gareng, Petruk, and Bagong (Bagong does not appear in
            Surakarta-style wayang).[6] In some wayangs, he has a brother Togog
            (or Hyang Antaga), who is the servant-clown of a demonic hero.

          <h2>Origin</h2>
          <p>
            As Semar is one of the few characters in wayang stories not from
            Indian mythology, his origin is obscure. One hypothesis is that he
            and his sons are old indigenous deities who became cursed and
            demoted to servants with the importation of the kshatriya heroes of
            the Indian epics. Semar also resembles the vidusaka clown figure of
            Indian Sanskrit drama.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first known appearance of Semar is during the Majapahit era. In
            1358 in relief of Sudamala in Candi TIgamangi, and in Candi Sukuh
            dated 1439. The relief was copied from a wayang story from the
            period, where Semar was first known to be appeared.

          <h2>Stories</h2>
          <p>
            In one version of the Babad Tanah Jawi (the Javanese creation myth),
            Semar cultivated a small rice field near Mount Merbabu for ten
            thousand years before there were any men. His descendants, the
            spirits of the island, came into conflict with people as they
            cleared fields and populated the island. A powerful priest, unable
            to deviate from his king's orders to continue cultivating the
            island, provided Semar with a role that will allow his children and
            grandchildren to stay. Semar's role was to be a spiritual advisor
            and magical supporter of the royalty, and those of his descendants
            who also protect the humans of Java can remain there.
          </p>
          <p>
            ne genealogy of Semar is that he is the eldest descendant of God,
            and elder brother to Batara Guru, king of the other gods; however,
            Semar became a man. Another genealogy says that he is the son of
            Adam and Eve. His brother Nabi ("prophet") Sis gave birth to various
            prophets, such as Jesus and Muhammad, from whom the various Western
            peoples are descended, while Semar ("Sayang Sis") gave birth to the
            Hindus and the Javanese. In either case Semar, in his awkward, ugly
            human form, represents at the same time god and clown, the most
            spiritually refined and outwardly rough.
